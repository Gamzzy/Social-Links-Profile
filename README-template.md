## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

Is the CSS properties which i used to designed is not 100% suited for the design. Will be revisiting this design in the future. Noticed that there are other ways to center a div aside using margin.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.handles .Github:hover {
        color: black;
        background-color: rgb(168, 218, 32);
        font-weight: bold;   
}

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

Where i need to focus on is using different methods to center a div. Work in Progress for this aspect of my learning.

I can't thank W3Schools & Frontend Mentor enough, using their materials to build and understand how is being built has been the best thing that happened to me.
